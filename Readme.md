# My Web Portfolio
Finally after few more iterations, i was able to built my Web Portfolio, I still need to reframe it properly. The Code needs to be refined.

Check it out @ [Ashish R Bhandari: Web Portfolio](https://aashishrbhandari.github.io)

I took reference of [3rdWaveMedia Bootstrap4 Theme](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/instance/bs4/)


# Upcoming [To Do]
- Problem: I see that their are alot of manual task that i have to do when i update with some new changes. which is currently doable but can be avoided.
- So my Plan is to Redesign it later and use more of JavaScript and make use of JSON data to Render the Content. i.e Add data in JSON and Populate it on Client Side.
- Later then use Maybe ReactJS, VueJS or Svelte to Develop it.
